# GrindCam

Capture webcam video to a file with timestamping and preview


## ffmpeg version

	bash grindcam.sh outfolder

requires ffmpeg with freetype and mplayer

	brew install ffmpeg --with-freetype
	brew install mplayer


## python version 

	python grindcam.py

(requires opencv version 2.x)

## why

I needed a low resource way to record video with timestamps for bruxism research
